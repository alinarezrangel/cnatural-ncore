# NCore Source Documentation #

All Markdown documents uses the [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/)
standard and are designed to be viewed using a tab width of 2 chars and,
at least, a 80 characters-wide screen. These documents are written to
hand, and not need to be exported to HTML to be correctly viewed.

When is possible, this documentation uses the PlainDocText format, which
is a simple plain-text file with some Markdown-AsciiDoc[tor] like features,
but this is designed to be viewed in plain text, not in a HTML-exported
document.

All documents uses the UTF-8 character encoding and ASCII-only viewers
will not show correctly the documents.

All documents uses the UNIX-like line ending (\n) so opening them in
Windows will show the document in a single line.
